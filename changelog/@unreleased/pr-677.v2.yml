    [fix] Prefer short names for Preconditions over fully-qualified names

    ## Before this PR
    The suggested fixes for safe logging Preconditions would always render the fully-qualified class name.

    ## After this PR
    The suggested fixes render short names, removing the Guava import, and adding the safe-logging import.
